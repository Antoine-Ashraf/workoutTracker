# workoutTracker

This Workout Tracker is a JavaScript-based application designed to help users log and manage their running and cycling activities. Built with an object-oriented architecture, the app organizes data using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation for modularity and maintainability.  

## Features  
- **Interactive Map Integration**: Utilizes the Geolocation API and Leaflet.js library to display real-time user locations and add dynamic workout markers.  
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Implements specialized classes for running and cycling activities, with shared functionality in a base class for cleaner and reusable code.  
- **Activity Metrics**: Automatically calculates and displays activity-specific data such as pace for running and speed for cycling.  
- **Input Validation**: Ensures accurate data entry with validation checks for numeric and positive values.  
- **Responsive UI**: Includes dynamic DOM updates, a toggleable form for input fields, and real-time updates to the activity list and map.  

This project is ideal for those learning JavaScript, particularly its ES6+ features, and exploring practical applications of object-oriented programming concepts. It also demonstrates integrating third-party libraries like Leaflet.js for real-world functionality.
